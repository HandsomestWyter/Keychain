# Keychain
Keychain is a file structure that I use for USB flash drives. Key is designed to keep privacy in mind on your USB devices. Keychain is basically livin out of an external drive as opposed to living on your internal hard drive. This is because if you're hard drive were to be comprimised, fry, or be stolen, you won't risk loosing data. Mind you, having your important files on an external source, so it goes without saying that these files have to be encrypted and backed up.

## Software Needed
1. Protable Internet Browser (Hardened)
2. File Encryption Software
3. Password Manager
4. USB/External Hard Drive/External SSD of your choice. Get something that's reasonable in size.

## Software Used
- Ungoogled Chromium
- Veracrypt
- KeePassXC

## THE PORTABLE INTERNET BROWSER
For this, I choose Ungoogled Chromium Portabled from [Portapps](https://github.com/portapps). They make it super easy to work with. I'm sure you've alredy heard of this browser so I won't be dwelling on it all too much. However, what I did do, is add a profile with my bookmarks that I tend to use a lot and add some extensions, so I can get up and running should I need to reset Keychain. Mind you, I'll be updating it ever month or so, since Browsers tend to be updated rather frequently, and I don't have the time to keep this project up-to-date. I alo changed the default search engine to Starpage, instead of DuckDuckGo.

### Bookmarks Added
1. Normie Book Marks

### Extensions
1. Chromium Webstore

4. NordVPN (I use Nord, but you can use whatever you want)
